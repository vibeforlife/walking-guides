Optional boss level: the Lanikai Pillboxes. If you do this stop, you’re officially in the “views are my love language” club.

These “pillboxes” are WWII-era military observation bunkers — concrete structures built to monitor coastline approaches. Utility first, beauty later.

History: during WWII, Hawaiʻi’s strategic importance skyrocketed. Oʻahu became a major defense and logistics hub across the Pacific. Observation posts like these were part of a network designed to watch the horizon.

Human story: generations of people climb up here and have the same arc — effort, sweat, maybe a complaint, and then the view resets your brain. The Mokulua Islands, the curve of the coast, and that “oh wow” moment.

Nature note: you’ll feel trade winds stronger up here. Clouds move quickly. Sudden showers happen. Shallow reefs and sun angle create that famous turquoise water below.

Insider tips:
• Go early: cooler, quieter, better light.
• Bring water. No vendors. Pack like a responsible legend.
• Be mindful of slippery sections after rain.

Fun facts:
• Built for defense, adopted by hikers and photographers.
• “Pillbox” is a nickname for small fortified structures.

If you remember one thing about the Lanikai Pillboxes, remember this: they were built to watch for danger — and today they’re a place to watch beauty, where history and landscape share the same horizon.
