Take a look at that iconic silhouette: that’s Lēʻahi, commonly called Diamond Head.

Start with the Hawaiian name: “Lēʻahi” is often translated as “brow of the tuna.” Once you hear that, the profile starts to make sense. Hawaiian place names often describe what people see, and they’re usually more accurate than later tourist names.

Now the “Diamond Head” name: sailors in the 1800s saw sparkling crystals on the slopes and thought, “Diamonds!” Not diamonds. The sparkles were calcite. But the name stuck — because branding is forever.

Geology time: Diamond Head is a tuff cone, formed by explosive volcanic activity. Ash and fine material blasted into the air, settled, and hardened into rock. Erosion sculpted it into the shape we recognize. Nature did dramatic architecture with no committee meetings.

Historically, Lēʻahi became strategically important. Its elevation made it a valuable lookout in the early 1900s. Pretty and practical.

Nature note: these slopes can be drier than the windward side. Trade winds and rainfall patterns create microclimates — you can drive 30 minutes and feel like you’ve entered a different season.

Human story: for locals, Lēʻahi is orientation. You always know where you are if you can see it. It’s part of the mental map of Oʻahu.

Insider tips:
• Morning and late afternoon reveal textures that midday glare flattens.
• If you hike, go early. Heat and crowds compound fast.

Fun facts:
• The “diamond” name is literally a misunderstanding turned permanent.
• Lēʻahi is one of the most photographed landforms in Hawaiʻi for a reason.

If you remember one thing about Lēʻahi (Diamond Head), remember this: it isn’t a backdrop — it’s a compass that anchors Oʻahu’s identity in both geology and daily life.
