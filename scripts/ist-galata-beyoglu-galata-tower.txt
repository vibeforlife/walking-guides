Alright, meet the tower that’s basically Istanbul’s ‘I’ve been here forever’ flex.

What you’re seeing:
A tall medieval stone tower rising over the Galata neighborhood, surrounded by winding streets.

Why this stop matters:
It’s a landmark of the city’s layered past—Byzantine, Genoese, Ottoman—and still a compass point for visitors.

Historical snapshot:
Completed in the 14th century in the Genoese era, it later served various roles including observation and fire watching.

The human story:
Imagine a night watch scanning for fire, a sailor using it as a waypoint, a kid daring friends to run up the hill to it.

Look closer (Views):
Even if you don’t go up, circle the base and look outward—this hill gives you natural ‘city map’ perspective.

Cheap eats / insider tip:
Pro photo move: step back into a side street and frame the tower between buildings.

Fun facts:
• Originally a medieval Genoese tower (14th century).
• Its viewpoint is one of the city’s classics.

If you remember one thing about this place, remember this:
Landmarks work because they give your memories a spine. This one is a stone exclamation point.
