Welcome to the St. Lawrence Market area. Cities begin with food, and Toronto began here. For over two centuries, this area fed a growing population of newcomers and locals alike. Brick warehouses, civic halls, and market stalls tell the story of survival turning into culture. If you remember one thing: cities grow because people need lunch.
